### Description:

Data normalization transforms features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values. It is critical for models that are sensitive to scale (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks). In this project, weâ€™ll demonstrate and compare Min-Max Scaling, Z-score Standardization, and Max Abs Scaling using a synthetic dataset.

- Min-Max Scaling: Rescales values to [0, 1]
- Z-Score Standardization: Centers around mean (0) and scales to unit variance
- Max-Abs Scaling: Scales by maximum absolute value (retains sparsity)

## Data Scaling Techniques in Python

This script demonstrates three popular data scaling techniques using a small sample dataset. Scaling is an important step in preprocessing data for machine learning algorithms, especially those that rely on distance metrics (like k-NN, SVM, etc.).

### Libraries Used

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, MaxAbsScaler
```

* `numpy` and `pandas` are used for handling numerical and tabular data.
* `MinMaxScaler`, `StandardScaler`, and `MaxAbsScaler` are scaling tools from `scikit-learn`.

### Sample Dataset

```python
data = {
    'Feature_1': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],   # Large range
    'Feature_2': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],             # Small range
    'Feature_3': [-50, -25, 0, 25, 50]        # Negative to positive
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original Data:\n", df)
```

This dataset includes three features with differing value ranges:

* `Feature_1`: Large values
* `Feature_2`: Small values
* `Feature_3`: Spans negative to positive

### 1. Min-Max Scaling

```python
minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_minmax = pd.DataFrame(minmax_scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
print("\nMin-Max Scaled Data:\n", df_minmax)
```

* Scales features to a fixed range, usually \[0, 1].
* Formula: `(X - X.min) / (X.max - X.min)`

### 2. Z-Score Standardization (Standard Scaling)

```python
standard_scaler = StandardScaler()
df_standard = pd.DataFrame(standard_scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
print("\nZ-Score Standardized Data:\n", df_standard)
```

* Centers data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
* Formula: `(X - mean) / std`

### 3. Max-Abs Scaling

```python
maxabs_scaler = MaxAbsScaler()
df_maxabs = pd.DataFrame(maxabs_scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
print("\nMax-Abs Scaled Data:\n", df_maxabs)
```

* Scales each feature by its maximum absolute value.
* Maintains sparsity of data; useful for data with zero-centered distribution.

### Summary

| Feature    | Original Range | Min-Max Range | Z-Score Mean\~0 | Max-Abs Range |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Feature\_1 | 100 to 500     | 0 to 1        | -1.41 to 1.41   | 0.2 to 1.0    |
| Feature\_2 | 1 to 5         | 0 to 1        | -1.41 to 1.41   | 0.2 to 1.0    |
| Feature\_3 | -50 to 50      | 0 to 1        | -1.41 to 1.41   | -1.0 to 1.0   |

Each scaling method serves different purposes and choosing the right one depends on the algorithm and nature of the data.
